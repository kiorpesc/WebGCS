To prepare testing framework, RUN

npm test

This will check that npm install and bower install have been run.

It will then launch the Karma server, which will automatically
run tests as the watched files change.


To run web tests (known as end-to-end tests):
npm start
in a new tab, type:
npm run protractor

The tests will be run.
